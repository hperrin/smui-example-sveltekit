## A Note About SvelteKit

From the SvelteKit website:

> SvelteKit is in early development, and some things may change before we hit version 1.0. This document is a work-in-progress. If you get stuck, reach out for help in the [Discord chatroom](https://svelte.dev/chat).

As such, this repo might break during SvelteKit's development. If it does, please ping me (@SylphWeed) in [the SMUI support Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aFzmkrmg9P).
